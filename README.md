# HNG12 Backend API

This is a public API developed for the HNG12 Stage 0 Backend task. It provides basic information such as your email, the current date and time in ISO 8601 format, and the GitHub URL of this repository.

## Setup Instructions

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Ayobmidele/info_api.git
```

2. Install dependencies:

5. In the same project directory, create a new file named `.env`.

6. Paste the contents you copied from `.env.sample` into your newly created `.env` file.

```
